I've used Protractor framework as part of this test.

Running test:
1. Clone repository to a local machine
2. cd to that folder and run from command line: npm i
3. Open another tab of cmd and run: webdriver-manager start
4. Get back to first cmd tab and run: protractor conf.js
5. Test will execute and console will log out the number and names of the categories
