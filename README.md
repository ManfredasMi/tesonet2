I'm used to working with Protactor framework, didn't want to spend too much time on setting up the workspace, so I've used protractor for running the tests(Protractor itself uses Jasmine).

Running tests:
1. Clone repository to a local machine
2. Run in cmd: npm i
3. Open another tab of cmd and run: webdriver-manager start
4. Get back to first cmd tab and run: protractor conf.js
5. Console will log out the number and names of the categories
